# My First Bootstrap Website

## Overview

Going back to old time (laughing wala emoji)(hehehe)...
This is a simple website I built during the initial days of learning **Bootstrap**. It was my first attempt at creating a responsive website using **only Bootstrap**, without any custom CSS. I used Bootstrap's built-in classes and components to design the layout and make the website responsive. This project helped me understand how Bootstrap can be leveraged to build modern and responsive websites quickly.

## Purpose

The website was created to practice and get familiar with the fundamentals of **Bootstrap**. I focused solely on using Bootstrap's grid system, utility classes, and components to structure the site. No custom CSS was written for styling, as I wanted to explore how much could be achieved with just the framework itself.

The website contains the following sections:

- **Navbar**: A responsive navigation bar created using Bootstrapâ€™s navbar component.
- **Carousel**: A responsive image carousel to showcase images.
- **About Section**: A brief introduction about myself.
- **Services Section**: Describes the services I offer.
- **Blog Section**: Displays a list of blog posts.
- **FAQ Section**: Frequently asked questions with a collapsible accordion.
- **Contact Section**: A simple contact form and embedded Google Map.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **Bootstrap**: For layout, responsive design, and styling (without custom CSS).
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements like the carousel.

## My Learning Experience

Building this website was one of the first steps in my web development journey. By using **only Bootstrap**, I was able to focus on learning how to utilize the built-in components and utilities provided by the framework. It helped me get familiar with **responsive design** and the **grid system** without needing to write custom CSS.

At the time, I was learning how to:

- Create a responsive layout using **Bootstrap's grid system**.
- Use built-in **Bootstrap components** like **carousel**, **navbar**, and **accordion**.
- Implement responsive elements with **only Bootstrap** and no custom styling.

## Conclusion

This website is a reflection of my first learning experience with **Bootstrap**. It helped me understand how to create a responsive and functional website using only the framework, without the need for any custom CSS. It was an exciting starting point, and I continue to build on this knowledge to create more complex projects as I grow my web development skills!
